			<h1>Reading 5</h1>
			<p>The reading of Scroll, Skim, and Stare gave me a fresh view of the artists’ websites and also how contemporary art is so different because of the world of the website. Contemporary art became so doable and approachable because everyone has access to the internet world and send their creations on living. Therefore, artists’ websites become more important to show as their aesthetic in my opinion. Like what the reading suggests that their websites become like their exhibition spaces that 24/7 open to the public.  </p>
