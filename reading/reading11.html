			<h1>Reading 11</h1>
			<p>can jokes bring down the government? (11.14)<br>In this reading, I found out it’s really interesting to see how the physical world gets impact so much bu the online place, the internet place, which is something you can physically see it and be there. However, it’s making different changes in your lives directly. And Of course, it’s going to take a bigger and bigger part of our lives. I love to ask and question if the same thing can be the other way around? Can the physical world impacts the Internet space?
