			<h1>Reading 6</h1>
			<p>In defense of the Poor image-When it comes to images, I think people are always trying to find the best quality to present the idea of it. However, after doing this reading, it makes me think about what if the images are the other way around like what we think. What if the quality of the images if very bad if the picture is very blurry? It might have a more dramatic effect than it was before. It might be more meaningful for the photographer or the viewer. The poor image can change the way people look at a thing.  </p>
