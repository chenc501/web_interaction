			<h1>Reading 2</h1>
			<p>The reading “What is Code” from Paul Ford is hard to understand for me at the beginning. He used some technical words to describe coding, which is what people usually think it s. However, after a paragraph, he started to use some real examples. My favorite quote is “Computer is a clock with benefits” The idea that we can also do what the computer is doing in a much slower way is so simple and true. The relationship between hardware, software, and coding is so close between each of them. They rely on each other to survive in the world. This reading defiantly gave me a new perspective to look at the coding world. It’s everywhere in our lives.  </p>
