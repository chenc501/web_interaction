			<h1>Reading 7</h1>
			<p>A handmade web- When we think about modern technology or the website, it always gives people the impression of the automatic and machinery that things are generated by the computer from the other world. However, the website is “handmade” in the way that the developer types everything out from their brain to the computer and uploads them into the server to make it works. This reading helps me to think about the website page more traditionally about web developing.   </p>
