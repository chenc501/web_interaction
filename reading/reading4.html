			<p>The Material Design website is really important to know for designer to create a more universal visual webpage or the interface. Especially if the designer is looking for making a website that has a cohesive look, having a universal visual language is very important. The whole article/ website gives the designer a standard from google that how things have been designed and how it has been read by the viewers.  </p>
