This reading is similar to my design philosophy. I think the design is just a way to create a more meaningful layer to make people believe in things. Especially in graphic design, when you see something they specially designed, you know people care about the information they are expressing so your information in more reliable. I wonder if you don’t have the resources to design things you want to express, does it come with a negative effect?
