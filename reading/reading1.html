			<h1>Reading 1</h1>
			<p>The Essay from Laurel Schwulst is really interesting for me because she described the website as a daily object that everyone can easily see and use. She mentioned that the website creator is just like architecture. We build the website just like they build the house. The website grows throughout the time when you are building it. However, in the end, she was talking about how Tim Berners Lee says that “while it’s called the “World Wide Web,” only about half the world is connected, so we should close this digital divide.” This makes me think about did we use the website properly in our time? Do we even think about how to maintain the website world in the long term? I think we should have a better use for the website in many different ways. We should use it more than just using it for entraining, which is what most of the time people use websites for. We should have more powerful usage to use the tool to make the world better.</p>
      		<p>If you have to describe the website as an object you use every day, what will it be?</p>
           <p> Is there any way we can originate the website world more logical?</p>
