			<h1>Reading 8</h1>
			<p>top 10 web design styles of 1993 (10.24)<br>
 
The reading is really interesting that it speaks how I think about web design before started to take the classes. I was imaging all the websites required heavy adobe design at the front and heavy coding at the back. I was so wrong and I’m in love with how the website has its language and the idea of how to make them as an aesthetic to present inferno of users. I’m wondering how to change this priest's impression when people think about website making. How to make people think they can make the website easily.
