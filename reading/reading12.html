			<h1>Reading 12</h1>
			<p>against software development (11.21)<br>
I think this is a really interesting topic to think about, should we trust with code, software development? Or should we be cautious when we are working with code? With such a relatively long history in software development. It has been such a powerful tool that be into everyone’s life. Will it be taken over in our lives? I wondered back in the day if we knew the software would become such a big deal, would we still have the same development in history?
