The human interface website from apple is really interesting to read in terms of how people are so used to those presentations that designers start to follow. I think it’s a good guideline to follow for the beginner or refer it back once a while. However, it will be even better if designers decide not to follow and go in another direction. That will be amazing, no one is going to judge hahaha.
