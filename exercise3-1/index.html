					<p class="body-text">My name is Eric. Iâ€™m a graphic designer/ industrial product designer based in New York City. I'm originally from Taiwan and moved to Queens when I was in high school. I have an Advertisement Design background, currently, a senior completing the BFA degree from Parsons School of Design, majoring in Product design and minoring in Communication design. My design-related experience, consisting of both 2D graphics and 3D prototyping, has given me a range of practical capabilities. Red wine and Cheesecake are my two favorite things. </p>
